Recently Weve learned alot of new thimgs we learned that variables are actually just place holders. Thats there purpose they are place holders until you find something to put there they dont hold any value since they are place holders. But the main objective, the most important thing i learned was that functions are verbs for other expressions thats their purpose functions do things with values like numbers they do things like 2+2 the values would be 2 and the functions would be +. Coding really is connected to math theres so many similarities and connections that you also do in math just in a different layout.
