This week our main focus was the midterm test and it was really hard. i like questions like question 7 like those because all you have to do is fill in the blank and make sure they are in the same format as the contrct and in my opinoin thats pretty easy its not that hard thats why i picked this question because questions like those i usally am right. In question 7 contract is as shows

;show-score : string number string number = image 

the answer was

(show-score "redsox"6"cardinals"4) 

i knew that i was right because it follows the same format as the contract. But even though i got this right pretty fast there is another answer people might get confused with thinking that that is the right answer.

(show-score "redsox" "cardinals" 5 5 and i could see why people would get mixed up with this because it has the same stuff as the contract but it dosent have the strings and numbers in the correct places at first i thought that was the answer but then i saw it wasnt in proper format and thats how i knew it was wrong.
