This past week weve started to do a flag project and at first i didnt really know which one or what to start with but i found something out if you really look at the flag they're different layer to the flag and i also realized how some people might think its easy because most of the flag are just rectangle but it's actually pretty difficult and takes alot of time to do it involves alot of rotating. So far the part im at in my flag is doing the second diagonal line of the United Kingdom Flag and at first it was pretty hard it didnt really get what i was soppused to do at all but once you understand it it becomes more clear i partly understand it now but once i finish the diagonal lines its a piece of cake from there because all i have to do is make straight rectangles over the background and the diagonal rectangle then im done.
