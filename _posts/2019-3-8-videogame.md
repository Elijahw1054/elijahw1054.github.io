Elijah’s Videogame

Describe the role of the function in the video game program.
This is used to determine whether on not the coordinate is going to be on the screen i give it a number and make it so if its higher or maybe lower than this number it would appear on the screen depending on which one i pick higher or lower but then if i do the opposite(higher or lower which ever one it is) than it would not be on the screen
