Earlier in this week we were learning more about defining things and i found out that define is actually a function is something you could use over and over and it wont chnage, yea you could be defining different things but define by its self wont chnage.

 color purple

define is just a shotcut to find stuff easier making the computer understand your code.

Towards the end of the week we learned the reason the world needs coding and wiil always need it computer programming is replica of the real world that's how we prepare for stuff and see the cause and effect of things in the real world. programming involves alot of thinking and helps calculate stuff coding can make the insane come true that's coding will always be needed in the world its a big part of the future.
